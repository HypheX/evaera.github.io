  description: RadialSpriteSheetGenerator is a project that generates radial sprite sheets (what a surprise!). It is another project born out of necessity, because Roblox doesn't support clipping masks for images. It can generate a stereotypical "loading ring" or "circular progress indicator" out of any image you choose, paired with a Lua module that lets you pass in a percentage and it will autonatically pick the closest image from the sprite sheet.
